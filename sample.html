                <li>FORGED CYLINDER in 2 piece design with forged tube and cast supporting platen.</li>
                <li>PRE-COMPRESSED COLUMN-TENSIONED TIE ROD Design having the following advantages over Simple Tie-Rod Press.
                    <ul id="sublist">
                    <li>Quick Pressure Development during Extrusion and Upset operations. Rapid &amp; Smooth De-compression after extrusion</li>
                    <li>Minimises/Nullifies displacement of End Platen due to elogation of Tie Rods.</li>
                    <li>Minimises/Nullifies Variation in Tie Rod Stresses, thus eliminating 'Fatigue' failures.</li>
                    <li>Rigidly of the Press is number of times better than Simple Tie-Rod Press.</li>
                    <li>Possibility of Nut Loosening is totally eliminated and hence nut re-tightening /re-adjustments are not required.</li>
                    <li>Twisting of End Platen eliminated.</li>
                    <li>Alignment is perfectly maintained due to proper location of Parts.</li>
                    <li>Provides Solid support to the guides of Container and Moving Cross Head.</li>
                    <li>The Tie Rod Sagging due to weight of Container and Moving Cross Head is totally eliminated</li>
                    <li>Ensures perfect parallelism between End Platen and Cylinder etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Jacket type Resistance Heaters are fitted In Container Housing &amp; Ceramic Fibre Is used as Heat Insulator. This kind of construction eliminates holes on the Container Mantle, thereby Increasing Its life.</li>
                <li>Container is located in a single piece Container Housing. Therefore easy &amp; quick removal of Container from Container Housing is possible, as against tedious handling ¡n Split Container Housing.</li>
                <li>Adjustable Flat “X" Guides for Moving Frame (Stem) &amp; Container Housing with replaceable Wear Plates. The Stem and Container thereforecan be aligned accurately. The “X” Guides have many advantages over Flat Guides like perfect alignment between Container and Main Moving Cross Head etc.</li>
                <li>The Hydraulic System Is built with the use of Logic Valves as per DIN STANDARDS. This System has advantages Ike Fast Response, Minimum Internal Leakage, Smooth Operations, Low Pressure Losses, Standardisation of Components, Long Life and Trouble-Free Operation etc., as compared to the other traditional systems. The Manifold construction reduces dumsy piping and Oil leakage.</li>
                <li>Hydraulic controls, are designed to ensure minimum spare Inventory and interchangeability.</li>
                <li>Container is located in single piece Container Housing. Therefore easy &amp; quick removal of Container from Container Housing is possible as against tedious handling in Split Container Housing.</li>
                <li>Centralised Lubrication System for Main Ram, Container Shear and Die-Slide Guides.</li>
                <li>Similar hydraulic control logic ensures minimum spare inventory and interchangability</li>
